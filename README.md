# Almost a circle
---
The Almost a circle project project is to test my skill on object oriented programming in python.

This project tries to help review everything about OOP in python, such as:
- Import
- Exceptions
- Class
- Private attributes
- Getters/Setters
- Class Methods
- Static Methods
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Read/Write file
Also reviews:
- args and kwargs
- Serialization and Deserislization
- JSON
